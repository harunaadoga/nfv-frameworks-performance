# VNFPerformanceComparison
In this work, we carried out a performance analysis, which considers the implementation of an NF at the dataplane (using a virtual switch) and as a separate vNF on the network. A firewall network function was abstracted and implemented using Open vSwitch, which is a production-grade virtual switch. Same firewall function configuration was deployed as a separate entity on the network. 
Results obtained using traffic sent at 1000Mbits/sec, by varying UDP packet sizes from 64B to 1500B, to a webserver, shows that the dataplane network function yields a much higher bandwidth and shows lesser CPU utilization (gets better with increase in packet size). For the largest UDP packet size used (1500B), the dataplane firewall scenario produced bandwidth close to line-rate (1GB), i.e. 97\% of line-rate performance was observed, as against 90\% for the vNF scenario.
We also report our findings while using multiple servers for the implementation, where an improved performance (obtainable bandwidth, CPU utilization and packets per second rates) was noticed, with the dataplane scenario outperforming the vNF approach and achieving line rate bandwidth from 512B packet sizes.
